[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/graphhopper/graphhopper)

GraphHopper is a fast and memory efficient Java road routing engine released under Apache License 2.0.
Per default it uses OpenStreetMap data but can import other data sources.

GraphHopper for the Web
--------------

See GraphHopper in action on [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps)

GraphHopper Maps uses the [Directions API for Business](https://graphhopper.com/#directions-api) under the hood, which provides 
a Routing API via GraphHopper, a Route Optimization API via [jsprit](http://jsprit.github.io/), a fast Matrix API
and an address search via [Photon](https://github.com/komoot/photon). Additionally the map tiles from various providers are used 
where the default is [Omniscale](http://omniscale.com/), and all is available for free, via encrypted connections and from German servers
for a nice and private route planning experience!
